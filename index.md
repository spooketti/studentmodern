## Who am I??
I am Jonathan Liu, and I started coding via horrible Unity games in around sixth grade, but I didn't take programming as seriously as I did until now.

I have experience in the following languages:
C++,HTML,Javascript,CSS,Python, and Unity C#.

I like to play electric/acoustic guitar, piano, play badminton, code, and do 3D art. 

Here are some projects I've worked on:

A chatting application with the Firebase database, [Crescent](https://spooketti.github.io/Crescent/)

A clone of Minesweeper I made because I hated not being able to use keyboard controls for the game, [Minesweeper](https://spooketti.github.io/minesweeper)

An (admittedly buggy) version of Solitaire I wrote while on a roadtrip, [Solitaire](https://spooketti.github.io/solitaire/)

This was part of a project regarding reading brainwaves, soldering, and Arduino.

## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 


- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.

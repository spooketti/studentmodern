<h3>Trimester 1 of AP CSP</h3>
<p>In the first trimester of AP Computer Science Principles I accomplished creating various projects and delved more into software development based in Jekyll. The trimester started with my development of this notebook, customizing it to my likings, and got ended the trimester with my social media project, <a href="https://spooketti.github.io/Phoenix">Phoenix</a>
It was fun working with databses and front end and back end models.

<h3>First Half of Trimester 2 of AP CSP</h3>
<p>In the first half of the second trimester of AP CSP, I lost one of my group members; however, I also got a new group member into my group so I got to work with new people. We began work on our <a href="https://spooketti.github.io/BinaryProj">Binary Project</a> and began development of our image editor project, VividFusion</p>

<h3>Peer Grading of the Binary Project</h3>

<p>
From this project I learned about how to improvise when things go horribly wrong. I had spent an hours worth of time trying to fix an issue with 
<br>Jupyter Notebook and trying to fix a javascript cell not working. I had finally came to the conclusion to code it on an external site. I had then done simple practice fixing the code, akin to leetcode problems. I have a portfolio site that uses these concepts which I have began adapting some of these ideas to. Overall I found the whole Web Programming Basics informative, especially the part involving Object Oriented Programming </p>

These are the questions I missed
<ul>
<li>13: The answer is C as books that aren't borrowed don't show up</li>
<li>15: The answer is A because both programs will print 10 values</li>
<li>20: The answer is A because the average is 10 not 100</li>
<li>21: The answer is B because of a miscalculation</li>
<li>32: The answer is D because it divides by the number of scores not the relevant scores</li>
<li>33: The answer is A because the highest score isn't recorded</li>
<li>39: The answer is C because the sum isn't saved at the right time</li>
<li>42: The answer is D because of a miscalculation</li>
<li>47: The answer is C for if it's in unsorted order it won't work</li>
<li>50: All of them are reasonable because they all are reasonable</li>
<li>67: Spruce isn't in the list so it works propperly</li>
</ul>

Overall I think I did alright, just some misunderstandings but otherwise I believe I will do good on the exam.
I learned and reflected on my understanding and all I need to improve on is understanding structure and internet security.

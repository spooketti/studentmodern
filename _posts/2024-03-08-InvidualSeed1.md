<h3>100% Seed Work</h3>

<h3>Foster Community of Learning</h3>

<p>My job last trimester was being the team's scrumm master and although I mainly worked in the backend, I also helped my team and guided them through learning the processes of JavaScript, VSCode, and other problems they faced along the way.</p>

<h3>AP Work</h3>
<a href="https://spooketti.github.io/portfolio/pages/CSPTri1Log.html">Tri 1 MCQ</a>
<a href="https://spooketti.github.io/studentmodern//2023/12/22/CollegeBoardMCQ.html">Tri 2 MCQ</a>
After all of these MCQs I feel like I'm getting better and better at what CollegeBoard has for the exam. The fundamentals of computer science may seem miniscule but are going to be very important on the exam and I'm hoping this practice will help me get a 4 or higher on the exam.
I went more into detail of the CPT Project on this blog <a href="https://spooketti.github.io/studentmodern//2024/01/18/Tri2Final.html">page</a>

<h3>Project Work/Key Commits</h3>
On the project I handled almost all of the backend work and let my team work on the frontend, I did of course come in to work and monitor their progress on the frontend. 
My key work was from the login page

But my key work was on the backend

My backend deployment:

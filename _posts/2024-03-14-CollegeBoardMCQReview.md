<p>It's Trimester 3 of AP CSP, time for a MCQ</p>
<h1>Problems I got wrong</h1>
<ul>
<li>
Question 13
<img src="/studentmodern/images/MCQ3/13.png">
I said that collaboration could make it easier; however, its for not and the answer is collaboration does not elimate the need to solve differences.
</li>
<li>
Question 36
<img src="/studentmodern/images/MCQ3/36.png">
I said that the problem was people redistributing without permission but the question is for least and least likely due to authentication measures
</li>
<li>
Question 55
<img src="/studentmodern/images/MCQ3/36.png">
I said that the answer is 
<pre>
<code>
len LENGTH(utensils)

temp utensils[len]

REMOVE(utensils, len)

APPEND(utensils, temp)
</code>
</pre>
but the answer is C as I want to insert and not append to the end
</li>
<li>
Question 63
<img src="/studentmodern/images/MCQ3/63.png">
I was right about one answer; however the answer is A and D and not C, as OR would be set to false by the NOT
</li>
<li>
Question 67
<img src="/studentmodern/images/MCQ3/67.png">
I was right about one answer; however the answer is A and D, not C, and D is correct as in the ELSE block of C its a 1 to 3 chance but in D is a 1 to 2 chance
</li>
</ul>

<p>Given my score on this MCQ I definitely feel confident in my abilites; however, I need to look more clearly at questions. I messed up one 2 just by not reading the question correctly, and I need to focus more on concepts (routing, internet, world wide web) than coding fundamentals</p>

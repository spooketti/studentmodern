<h3>Me and My team</h3>
<p>
Overall, our team despite the challenges of our situation were able to pull through quite well in the end.<br>
I'm very proud of us for being able to finish a complicated task within a short time period as we were shocked of the time frame we had for the CPT project and NATM.
<br>
<ul>
<li>Jonathan Liu: All of backend </li>
<li>Sri: Great work on the painter</li>
<li>Soham: Great work on the image editor</li>
<li>Deva: Great work on login UI</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Glow</h3>
<p>One strong glow of ours was working with new technology. Previously I had never have used SQLite for database work as I am more familiar with Firebase, and doing this made me quite intrigued on how I can further utilize this technology. Another growth was our ability to work within our given time frame. It was quite difficult getting everything in on time and coordinating through horrible merge errors, but I'm glad we managed to pull through and we carried our weight. At NATM I felt quite proud of our ability to present as we met with someone who was experienced with programming and we had a fun talk.</p>
<h3>Growth</h3>
<p>One big thing we will have to work on is time management. I was unhappy that I was unable to get all my ideas out into our project and the project is rushed in some aspects. Another big growth is server work, as we had problems with deployments and we overall could have worked better with our coordination. We also did not complete one feature and were forced to scrap it at the end, but despite all of these flaws I believe our project still proved well done.</p>

<h3>Something we will add will be a cleaner design as right now it seems to be an amalgamation of things compiled together, so I will look to make things more centralized.</h3>

<h3>Night At Thee Museum Itself!</h3>

<h3>Compsci</h3>

<h4>Buttonify</h4>
<p>One project I was helps make stylized buttons with ease, I wish I had something like this when I was working on my CPT project would have made my life easier.</p>

<h4>Job Finder</h4>
<p>Another Project I saw was of a service that aimed to help unemployed people find employment at nearby companies, maybe it could help me out someday</p>

While I was walking by the 3d Animation section of the Night At the Museum exhibit I saw some cool projects like this one.

<p>Natm was a fun experience for me, got to see the creative side of this school, which is always nice.</p>
